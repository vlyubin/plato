Debate the best public speakers in the world on any topic you'd like!

## Prerequisites

You will need an Openai API key (we're using gpt3.5) and Elevenlabs API key. If you're new to openai, you'll get ~$7 worth of free usage initially, and any further gpt3.5 usage is pretyy cheap. For Elevenlabs, you can get initial monthly membership for $1.

Create `credentials.txt` file in `server` directory that contains the following:

```
OPENAI_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_KEY=...
```

Then you'll be able to run everything.
